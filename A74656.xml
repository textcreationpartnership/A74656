         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He main deſigne of a Miniſter of the Goſpell, next to the glory of God, ſhould be the ſpirituall good, and advantage, as of the Church of God in generall, ſo of the flock committed to his charge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>Had not this conſideration been very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, and prevailing on my Spirit, it would not have been able, to have broke through thoſe many difficulties and diſcouragements (amongſt which the unworthineſſe, and weakneſſe of the Author was not the leaſt)
<pb facs="tcp:169966:3"/>
that did way-lay the publication of theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>The reſult of my thoughts being affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as to the preſenting of them to publike view, I determined to dedicate them to you my people.</p>
            <p>The reaſons that moved me to this, (beſides your intereſt in the compoſer of them, having been your Paſtor now, for ſome yeares; and the equity of it, that they that called for, and rejoyced in the firſt-fruits of his Miniſtery, ſhould have tendred unto them the firſt-fruits of his labours in this kind alſo) were ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I might be inſtrument all to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh you in ſome of the truths of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in theſe erroneous dayes; a fitter expedient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I know not any (next to the illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit) then the riight understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the text; For theſe late yeares eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the Devill hath walked up and downe our ſtreets with a Bible under his arme, and upon every turne pleads <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> It is written.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That you might be the more confirmed, concerning the ſweet harmony of the Scriptures; how one Scripture ſweetly embraces, and kiſſes each other, although there be many in the world, that would if they could <hi>(Horrendum ſcelus!)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169966:3"/>
make them to fall out, and mutiny. One cals the Old Teſtament, and the New, Gods two lips; whereby he breatheth out the ſame truth. Some have gone about to finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in them, but the ſpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was in them, that went about it. Oh that we could as well agree with them, as they agree with themſelves: while they are at peace in their doctrine, we are at warre in their interpretation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That you might take notice of the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome texts of Scripture. We may ſay of the whole booke of the Scriptures, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth of all <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles: <hi>In which are ſome things hard to be underſtood:</hi> Some <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16</note> things, though not all; there are ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent herbes in the garden of the Scriptures, whoſe names we know not. <hi>Difficilia quae pulchra.</hi> And theſe things, <hi>They that are unlearned, and unſtable, wreſt, as they do alſo, the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtruction.</hi> They deale with the Scriptures, as <hi>Chymiſts</hi> deale with naturall bodies, torturing them to extract ſomething out of them, which God and nature never put in them; Or as torturers deale with an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, make him ſpeake that which he never thought; A ſeaſonable Item for theſe dayes, when men think a ſmall meaſure of
<pb facs="tcp:169966:4"/>
gifts ſufficient for the interpretation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p>God would not have the weakeſt of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtarved, and therefore ſome truths are eaſy; nor the wiſeſt of them cloyd, and ſated, and therefore ſome truths are obſcure. Nor have we cauſe to murmur, or repine at this diſpenſation. Since the fall, the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of men, are ſhrunke up, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Shall the little viall be angry, becauſe it cannot containe the water in the Ocean? Shall the blind man blame the Sun, for ſhining no brighter?</p>
            <p n="4">4. That however God diſpoſe of me by his providence, I might leave ſomething in your hands, which might be for your ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: A Sermon, or Expoſition, if cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to minde, (and I hope this ſmall manuall may be your remembrancer) may do your ſouls good, ſeven, ten, twenty yeares after its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Phyſick doth not alwayes worke when it is taken, no more do the Ordinances. 'Tis ſaid there, <hi>That many reſorted unto Jeſus and ſaid,</hi> John <hi>did no miracle, but all things</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh</hi> 10. 41, 42.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> John <hi>ſpake of this man were true; and many beleeved on him there. John</hi> had Preached of <hi>Chriſt</hi> before, but they did not beleeve in <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he Preached; But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes amongst them; they upon
<pb facs="tcp:169966:4"/>
               <hi>Johns</hi> Sermons preached a great while before, then believed.</p>
            <p>You have in theſe papers, (for I thought it not ſafe to go without a guide, the way in many places being difficult) the conduct of ſeverall eminently learned Authors, burning and ſhining lights, at whoſe torch my candle received light, though I may ſay, to the praiſe of free-grace, it ſhines not altogether (unleſſe we referre to God) with a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and derivative luſtre, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>One of theſe things I ſtudied in this ſmall piece, was plaineneſſe; it being for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of it polemicall: And beſides, truth is an excellent Jewel, beſt when plain ſet.</p>
            <p>I have ſeverall counſells to you, lying neere my ſpirit, poſſibly I may have another opportunity to offer them. At preſent let me exhort you (as moſt pertinent to the buſineſſe in hand) to a diligent study of the Word of God; To this purpoſe, I have annexed by way of Appendix, certain directions for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures; if they may be of any advantage to you, bleſſe God for them.</p>

                     <p>The higheſt heaven, the heaven of the bleſſed, the dwelling place of glorified <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Saints and Angels, called alſo the <hi>heaven of heavens,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.27.</p>
                     <p>This heaven (I conceive) was made before the earth, although I lay not any ſtreſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the order of the words.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169966:6"/>
the world was compoſed (for the earth, to ſpeak ſtrictly, is without foundations, and hangeth upon nothing, like a round ball in the aire) when <hi>the morning ſtarres, viz.</hi> the Angels (for the lights of heaven, Sunne, Moone, and Starres were not yet created) ſang together? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe conſider,</p>
                     <p>That all kinds of beings were created the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt ſix dayes.</p>
                     <p>Angels are like the heaven in their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and incorruptibility, as alſo in their power over ſublunary, and earthly bodies, and therefore may be ſo called.</p>
                     <p>The Saints are called heaven ſeven times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in one Chapter, as carnal and eathly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, are called earth, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. And the <note place="margin">

                     <p>From the conſideration of the method, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that was taken by God in the Creation of man: ſo ſoone as mans ſeat was perfected, man was created; It is probable that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, when thoſe bleſſed inviſible manſions were finiſhed on the firſt day, the Angels were created.</p>
                     <p>By the <hi>earth</hi> is meant that whole confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chaos of earth and water, which was

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169966:17"/>
place, the ſeventh day muſt be ſaid to be ſanctified one of theſe two wayes:</p>
                     <p>Either by infuſion of holineſſe, or ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> into it; now the circumſtance of a ſeventh day, is not capable of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in this ſenſe, only rational creatures, Angels and men may be ſaid thus to be ſanctified.</p>
                     <p>By ſeparation of it from common uſe, and dedication of it to an holy uſe, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Temple and Tabernacle were, which had no inherent holineſſe in them.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Sabbath were thus ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt either be for the uſe of God, or man; either God muſt impoſe upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the obſervation of every ſeventh day to keep it holy, which is abſurd; or elſe it was dedicated and conſecrated for mans ſake and uſe: and if ſo, man had that which amounted to a poſitive Law for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Sabbath.</p>

                     <p>This that is urged is placed by God by <label type="milestone">

                     <p>This was one reaſon why the Sabbath <label type="milestone">

                     <p>The Jewes were to obſerve the Sabbath not only upon the ground of its firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but upon reaſons, proper, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that Nation.

                     <p>There is no creature in the world, that God hath made capable of knowing any thing of the firſt cauſe, but onely the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature: And it is the excellency of man, not onely to enjoy the good that he hath, but to be able to riſe up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and firſt cauſe of all good.

An horſe, that is neither good for the way, nor the cart, nor the race, nor any other ſervice, let him be of never ſo good a breed, never ſo well marked and ſhaped, yet he is but a Jade. His Maſter ſetteth nothing by him, every man will ſay, Better knock him in the head, then keep him. His skin, though not much worth, is yet better worth then the whole beaſt beſides.</p>
                     <p>Let us have a care therefore of giving up our ſelves to the vanities and pleaſures of the world; An idle mans brain is the Devils ſhop, where he forges all manner of ſinne. <hi>Nihil agendo, malè agere diſces: Hierom</hi> thought that action, and lawfull employment was a diſheartning to the Devil, and therefore he gives this advice, <hi>Semper aliquid age, ut te Diabolus inveniat occupatum;</hi> Put thy ſelfe upon ſome bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe

                     <p>The reaſons they give for this their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Heathens by the Light of Nature worſhipped God this way.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Law of Nature doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us not onely to the worſhip of God; but to ſuch a worſhip as might moſt fitly ſet forth the Majeſtie and dominion of God, and the ſubjection and homage of man, and this was beſt repreſented by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>

God by ſacrifices, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to be proved, that they knew this way of worſhip by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſecond, it doth not appeare (but by the intervention of a poſitive Law of God obliging thereunto) that the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or ſacrificing of a brute creature was the beſt way of worſhip to ſet forth Gods ſoveraignty, or our homage.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, as to the anſwer of this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we affirme that by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we may know that God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, and that with inward and outward worſhip, but deny that this kinde of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is to be found out by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>The Orthodoxy of this perſwaſion will be cleared up, if we conſider, that the killing or ſacrificing of a beaſt did not pleaſe God any further then as it was a type of Chriſt; now the doctrine of Chriſt being ſuch a myſtery, as never yet hath been diſcovered by the Light of Nature, the ſame may be ſaid concerning this way of worſhip that pointed thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

You may aske me, what are the cauſes of an holy Anger?</p>
                     <p>I muſt not enlarge in this; therefore in a few words,</p>
                     <p>Holy anger ariſes from our love unto God, and our hatred againſt ſin.</p>
                     <p>And herein appeared the exceeding ſinfulneſſe of <hi>Cains</hi> wrath, that whereas he ſhould have been angry with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſin, he was angry with his brothers righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>And that his rage was great, appeares by the text; for it is ſaid, <hi>He was very wrath, and his countenance fell.</hi> One gloſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it thus, <hi>Ex ira vultus</hi> Caini <hi>demititur in terram: nonne Deus tibi faciem rectam conceſſit, cur pronam et ſimilem bestiis, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis? Non miror</hi> Cainum <hi>ſimilem animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus iratus enim erat, at iratus expers eſt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis rationis.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Cains</hi> countenance fell: God gave him a face erect looking up towards heaven, but now in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he ſeems to be void of reaſon, and his countenance falls, as if he were a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>Let this caution us againſt paſſion upon every turne, let us enquire why we are wroth? He will make a ſtrange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion in his ſoul, who at the landing of

every Cock-boat, (upon every triviall occaſion) ſets the Beacons on fire. He that will be angry for every thing, will be angry for nothing, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle gives us an exhortation, <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the doy of redemption:</hi> But <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 30.</note> what courſe muſt we take that we may not grieve the Spirit?

                        <hi>be put away from you with all malice.</hi> The Spirit of God cannot endure an unquiet habitation. It is obſervable, how many times in the Scriptures the Spirit of God appeales to the reaſons and underſtandings of men; as here, why art thou wroth, and why is thy countenance fallen? Nothing more irrationall then irreligion<hi>:</hi> when a man is intemperate, unjuſt, paſſionate, he acts not onely againſt Scripture, but againſt principles of reaſon, and ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If God had not commanded us to be ſober, juſt, temperate in our affections, it is for our intereſt ſo to be; the commands of God, like <hi>Benjamins</hi> ſack, have money in the mouth of them; in the keeping the Commandements there is exceeing great reward; wicked men are mad in a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſure-ſenſe;

The Prodigall came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when he came to his Father.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another reaſon why God might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this queſtion to <hi>Cain</hi> might be this, to note unto us that when wicked men are not accepted, they are apt to caſt the blame upon God<hi>:</hi> why art thou wroth? Thou ſeemeſt to be angry with thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe ſacrifice is accepted, but indeed thou art angry with God, who accepted the ſacrifice. Thou ſtrikeſt at the Head, and becauſe thou canſt not reach that, thou woundeſt the Heele.</p>
                     <p>Proud daring ſinners, to lay the blame on God<hi>:</hi> It is fooliſh to caſt our ſins alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on Satan, but it is blaſphemous to caſt them upon God. Sin is a baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brood, it is conceived and brought forth by man, and yet if you lay it at his doore he will not father it.</p>
                     <p>It is the obſervation of a Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, man naturally hateth God, and ſince he cannot raſe out the ſenſe of a Deity out of his ſoul, he would deſtroy the dread and reverence of it.

3. A third Reaſon may be ro teach us, that God will call the wicked to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every evil work.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. For ſinnes of commiſſion, <hi>Rejoyce, Oh young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walk in the wayes of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know thou that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgement:</hi> For al theſe things, theſe trifles, theſe tricks of youth, as the world accounts them: Item for thy Oaths, Item for thy Lyes, Item for thy Cozening, Item for thy drunkenneſſe, Item for thy Hypocriſy, for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgement: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are the children of God, but it doth not yet appeare what we ſhall be; viz.</hi> there is more glory in heaven, then the people of God are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſo wicked men are now the children of wrath, but it doth not appeare what

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169966:84"/>
that he ſhould have any care of him.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome learned men, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, (I ſuppoſe the impudency of <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſpeech inclined them thereunto) that this debate was between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and that God is ſaid to ſpeak to <hi>Cain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had it by inſtinct from God.</p>

There is ſuch a combination of ſinne, as in the links of a chaine; if a man draw one link all the reſt will follow, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice follows after anger, murther after hatred, Adultery after drunkenneſſe.

Some diſtinguiſh between, a prediction or Prophecy, and a threat. A Prophecy, ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they, is alwayes fulfilled, but a threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as this is, may be mitigated; and that it is in the power of him who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it, to abate the ſeverity thereof.</p>
                     <p>Though he built a City, yet he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> an exile, baniſhed from his fathers houſe, his native countrey, from communion with the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Although this may ſeem at firſt to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> contrary to what the Lord had denounced, yet doth it marvellouſly in truth agree with it.</p>
                     <p>The ſtock of <hi>Adam</hi> encreaſeth, as well by <hi>Seth,</hi> as by <hi>Catn,</hi> and yet none of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is ſaid to build a City before the flood<hi>:</hi> And wherefore not? Becauſe the Lord had given them the plenty of the earth, and was a ſtronger defence to them then the walls of any City: but <hi>Cain,</hi> who was departed from the preſence of the Lord, was compelled to build a City for his defence: not for pleaſure, but for ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the ſin of profeſſors: what is the cry in the world? (I would there were not too much cauſe for it) it is true, they profeſſe much, and heare Sermons, and would be accounted Saints, but are as griping, as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as earthly as others.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For inſtance, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Chriſts</hi> temptations, <hi>Matthew</hi> for the ſecond temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <note place="margin">Mat. 4 5.</note> puts the devills <hi>taking Chriſt up into the holy City, and ſetting him one a pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the temple;</hi> now the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſeemes to invert the order, and for the ſecond temptation puts <hi>the devills ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>

Anſwer may be made, if there be an harmony, as to the temptations that are written by the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> it is enough, though they differ as to the order of the temptations. We do not uſe to accuſe a man of a falſhood, who tells us many things that be true, though they be ſomething out of order, unleſſe he promiſe that he will not onely tell us the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169966:139"/>

4. The complete knowledge of Divine Myſteries is reſerved for our heavenly ſtate: whileſt we are in this world, <hi>we know but in part.</hi> Yea, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> addes, ſaith he, In glory to all eternity, the Saints ſhall be learning ſomething of God, that ſo God to eternity may be a Teacher, and the Saint a learner. There is ſuch another like expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the <hi>Schools</hi> make uſe of, when they ſpeak of our ſtate in glory; they ſay. The <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Saints,</hi> are full veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and yet are alwayes a filling.</p>
